# Project_2_Group_1

## Chosen Topic and Rationale
For this project, our team decided to work with movie score data from IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes. Our goal was to allow users to filter through top 100 movie scores and display the information in different visualization formats. Visualizations include the following: a scatterplot that displays varying data based on drop-down selection, and a donut chart describing gross profit globally and nationally.

## Target Audience
The film buff, theatre owner, or curious data enthusiast â€“ anyone with an interest in movies could enjoy perusing our data visualizations!
